# Process Sale Additional Higher Grade Tasks
This repo is an extension of the original codebase available [here](https://github.com/Filune/IV1350-Seminar4-Process-Sale). In addition to the core functionality of the original project, this extended version incorporates functionality from three additional tasks, each offering 1 credit towards achieving a higher grade.

## Tasks
* Template Pattern: Implementing this design pattern to the payment observers.
* Inheritance versus Composition: Exploring the pros and cons of inheritance versus composition.
* Testing output: Testing all parts of the code that output text to System.out with the help of JUnit.

These tasks served as valuable learning opportunities to delve into advanced software design concepts and reinforce knowledge in object-oriented programming principles and testing methodologies.
